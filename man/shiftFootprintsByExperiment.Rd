}
\arguments{
\item{df}{an ORFik \code{\link{experiment}}}

\item{out.dir}{output directory for files,
default: dirname(df$filepath[1]), making a /pshifted
folder at that location}

\item{start}{(logical) Whether to include predictions based on the start
codons. Default TRUE.}

\item{stop}{(logical) Whether to include predictions based on the stop
codons. Default FASLE. Only use if there exists 3' UTRs for the annotation.}

\item{top_tx}{(integer) Specify which % of the top covered by RiboSeq reads
transcripts to use for estimation of the shifts. By default we take top 10%
top covered transcripts as they represent less noisy dataset. This is only
applicable when there are more than 1000 transcripts.}

\item{minFiveUTR}{(integer) minimum bp for 5' UTR during filtering for the
transcripts. Set to NULL if no 5' UTRs exists for annotation.}

\item{minCDS}{(integer) minimum bp for CDS during filtering for the
transcripts}

\item{minThreeUTR}{(integer) minimum bp for 3' UTR during filtering for the
transcripts. Set to NULL if no 3' UTRs exists for annotation.}

\item{firstN}{(integer) Represents how many bases of the transcripts
downstream of start codons to use for initial estimation of the
periodicity.}

\item{min_reads}{default (1000), how many reads must a read-length have to
be considered for periodicity.}

\item{accepted.lengths}{accepted readlengths, default 1:1000, usually ribo-seq
is between 26:34.}

\item{output_format}{default (bed), use export.bed or ORFik optimized
(bedo) using \code{\link{export.bedo}} ?}
}
\value{
NULL (Objects are saved to out.dir/pshited/"name")
}
\description{
Saves files to a specified location as .bed, it will include a score column
containing read width.
