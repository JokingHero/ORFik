\title{Plot area around TIS for p-shifted reads}
\usage{
pSitePlot(hitMap, length = 29, region = "start", output = NULL,
  type = "canonical CDS", scoring = "Averaged counts")
}
\arguments{
\item{hitMap}{a data.frame/data.table, given from metaWindow
(must have columns: position, (score or count) and frame)}

\item{length}{an integer (29), which length is this for?}

\item{region}{a character (start), either "start or "stop"}

\item{output}{character (NULL), if set, saves the plot as pdf or png
to path given. If no format is given, is save as pdf.}

\item{type}{character (canonical CDS), type for plot}

\item{scoring}{character (Average sum) which scoring did you use ?}
}
\value{
a ggplot object of the coverage plot, NULL if output is set,
then the plot will only be saved to location.
}
\description{
Usefull to validate p-shifting is correct
Can be used for any coverage of region around a point, like TIS, TSS,
stop site etc.
}
\details{
Remember if you want to change anything like colors, just return the
ggplot object, and reassign like: obj + scale_color_brewer() etc.

# An ORF
grl <- GRangesList(tx1 = GRanges("1", IRanges(1, 6), "+"))
# Ribo-seq reads
range <- IRanges(c(rep(1, 3), 2, 3, rep(4, 2), 5, 6), width = 1 )
reads <- GRanges("1", range, "+")
