\usage{
pmapToTranscriptF(
  x,
  transcripts,
  ignore.strand = FALSE,
  x.is.sorted = TRUE,
  tx.is.sorted = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{GRangesList/GRanges/IRangesList/IRanges to map
to transcriptomic coordinates}

\item{transcripts}{a GRangesList/GRanges/IRangesList/IRanges to
map against (the genomic coordinates). Must be of lower abstraction level
than x. So if x is GRanges, transcripts can not be IRanges etc.}

\item{ignore.strand}{When ignore.strand is TRUE, strand is ignored in
overlaps operations (i.e., all strands are considered "+") and the
strand in the output is '*'. \cr
When ignore.strand is FALSE (default) strand in the output is taken from the
transcripts argument. When transcripts is a GRangesList, all inner list
elements of a common list element must have the same strand
or an error is thrown. \cr
Mapped position is computed by counting from the transcription start site
 (TSS) and is not affected by the value of ignore.strand.}

\item{x.is.sorted}{if x is a GRangesList object, are "-" strand groups pre-sorted
in decreasing order within group, default: TRUE}

\item{tx.is.sorted}{if transcripts is a GRangesList object,
are "-" strand groups pre-sorted in decreasing order within group,
default: TRUE}
}
\value{
object of same class as input x, names from ranges are kept.
}
\description{
Map range coordinates between features in the transcriptome and
genome (reference) space.
The length of x must be the same as length of transcripts. Only exception is
if x have integer names like (1, 3, 3, 5), so that x[1] maps to 1, x[2] maps
to transcript 3 etc.
}
\details{
This version tries to fix the shortcommings of GenomicFeature's version.
Much faster and uses less memory.
Implemented as dynamic program optimized c++ code.

\examples{
ranges <- IRanges(start = c(5, 6), end = c(10, 10))
seqnames = rep("chr1", 2)
strands = rep("-", 2)
grl <- split(GRanges(seqnames, IRanges(c(85, 70), c(89, 82)), strands),
             c(1, 1))
ranges <- split(ranges, c(1,1)) # both should be mapped to transcript 1
pmapFromTranscriptF(ranges, grl, TRUE)
