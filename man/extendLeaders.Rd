\title{Extend the leaders tss.}
\usage{
extendLeaders(grl, extension = 1000, cds = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{grl}{a \code{\link[GenomicRanges]{GRangesList}}
of 5' utrs or transcripts..}

\item{extension}{an integer, how much to extend the leaders.
Or a GRangesList where start / stops by strand are the positions
to use as new starts.}

\item{cds}{If you want to extend 5' leaders downstream, to catch
upstream ORFs going into cds, include it. It will add first
cds exon to grl matched by names.
Do not add for transcripts, as they are already included.}
}
\value{
an extended GRangeslist
}
\description{
Either if you have the 5' utr sequences or the
 transcript sequences to extend,
 any way the 5' part will be extended.
 Remember to sort it, if not sorted beforehand.
 use ORFik:::sortPerGroup(grl) to get sorted grl.
}
\examples{
library(GenomicFeatures)
samplefile <- system.file("extdata", "hg19_knownGene_sample.sqlite",
package = "GenomicFeatures")
txdb <- loadDb(samplefile)
fiveUTRs <- fiveUTRsByTranscript(txdb) # <- extract only 5' leaders
tx <- exonsBy(txdb, by = "tx", use.names = TRUE)
cds <- cdsBy(txdb,"tx",use.names = TRUE)
## now try(extend upstream 1000, downstream 1st cds exons):
extendLeaders(fiveUTRs, extension = 1000, cds)

## when extending transcripts, don't include cds' ofcourse,
## since they are already there
extendLeaders(tx, extension = 1000)
