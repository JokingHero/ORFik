ORFik 1.0.0
-----------------------

    o first release of ORFik - find Open Reading Frames, automatic RiboSeq
    footprint shifts, reassignment of Transcription Start Sites with the use of
    CageSeq, plethora of gene identity functions from scientific publications

ORFik 1.3.2
-----------------------

    o Remade many function to handle no names correctly, like tile1 will now
    work even for GRangesList without names. Documentation is more logical, and
    removed coverageByWindow, since GenomicFeatures::coverageByTranscripts now
    works correctly.
