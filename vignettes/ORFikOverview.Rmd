# Introduction

Welcome to the `ORFik` package. This vignette will walk you through our main 
package usage with examples. `ORFik` is an R package containing various 
functions for analysis of RiboSeq, RNASeq and CageSeq data.  

`ORFik` currently supports:  

1. Finding Open Reading Frames (very fast) in the genome of interest or on the 
set of transcripts/sequences.  
2. Automatic estimations of RiboSeq footprint shift.  
3. Utilities for metaplots of RiboSeq coverage over gene START and STOP codons 
allowing to spot the shift.  
4. Shifting functions for the RiboSeq data.  
5. Finding new Transcription Start Sites with the use of CageSeq data.  
6. Various measurements of gene identity e.g. FLOSS, coverage, ORFscore, 
entropy that are recreated based on many scientific publications.  
7. Utility functions to extend GenomicRanges for faster grouping, splitting, 
tiling etc.  

# Finding Open Reading Frames 

In molecular genetics, an Open Reading Frame (ORF) is the part of a reading 
frame that has the ability to be translated. It does not mean that every ORF is
being translated or is functional, but to be able to find novel genes we must be
able to firstly identify potential ORFs.

To find all Open Reading Frames (ORFs) and possibly map them to genomic 
coordinates `ORFik` gives you three main functions:

* `findORFs` - find ORFs in sequences of interest,
* `findMapORFs` - find ORFs and map them to their respective genomic coordinates 
* `findORFsFasta` - find ORFs in Fasta file or `BSGenome` (supports circular genomes!)

## Example of finding ORFs in on 5' UTR of hg19

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
library(ORFik)
library(GenomicFeatures)
```

After laoding libraries, load example data from `GenomicFeatures`. We load gtf 
file as txdb. We will extract the 5' leaders to find all upstream open reading 
frames.

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
txdbFile <- system.file("extdata", "hg19_knownGene_sample.sqlite", 
                        package = "GenomicFeatures")
txdb <- loadDb(txdbFile)
fiveUTRs <- fiveUTRsByTranscript(txdb, use.names = TRUE)
fiveUTRs
```

As we can see we have extracted 5' UTRs for hg19 annotations. Now we can load
`BSgenome` version of human genome (hg19). If you don't have this package 
installed you will not see the result from the code below. You might have to 
install `BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19` and run the code for yourself as we don't
install this package together with `ORFik`.

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
if (requireNamespace("BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19")) {

  # Extract sequences of fiveUTRs.
  tx_seqs <- extractTranscriptSeqs(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19::Hsapiens, fiveUTRs) 
  
  # Find all ORFs on those transcripts and get their genomic coordinates
  fiveUTR_ORFs <- findMapORFs(fiveUTRs, tx_seqs)
  fiveUTR_ORFs
}
```

In the example above you can see that fiveUTR_ORFs are grouped by transcript, 
the first group is from transcript "uc010ogz.1". Meta-column names contains name 
of the transcript and identifier of the ORF separated by "_". When ORF is 
separated into two exons you can see it twice, like the first ORF with name 
"uc010ogz.1_1". The first ORF will always be the one most upstream for "+"" 
strand, and least upstream for "-"" strand.

# CageSeq data for 5' UTR re-annotation

In the prerevious example we used the refence annotation of the 5' UTRs
from the package GenomicFeatures. Here we will use advantage of CageSeq data to 
set new Transcription Start Sites (TSS) and re-annotate 5' UTRs.

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE} 
# path to example CageSeq data from hg19 heart sample
cageData <- system.file("extdata", "cage_data_heart.bed.bgz", 
                        package = "ORFik")
# get new Transcription Start Sites using CageSeq dataset
newFiveUTRs <- reassignTSSbyCage(fiveUTRs, cageData)
newFiveUTRs
```

You will now see that most of the transcription start sites have changed. 
Depending on the species, regular annotations might be incomplete or not 
specific enough for your purposes. 

From testing on Fantom5 CageSeq data, less than 1% of the start sites remain the 
same on average after re-assignment.

# Gene identity functions for ORFs or genes

`ORFik` contains couple functions of gene identity that can be used to predict 
which ORFs are potentially coding and functional.

- FLOSS `floss`,   
- coverage `coverage`,  
- ORFscore `orfScore`,  
- entropy `entropy`,  
- translational effiency `translationalEff`,  
- inside outside score `insideOutsideScore`,  
- distance between orfs and cds' `distToCds`,  
- other  

All of the features are implemented based on scientific article published in
per reviewed journal. `ORFik` supports seemingles calculation of all available 
features. See example below.

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
  # a example without cage-seq data:
  # we will find ORFs in the 5' utrs
  # and then calculate features on them

 if (requireNamespace("BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19")) {
  library(GenomicFeatures)
  # Get the gtf txdb file
  txdbFile <- system.file("extdata", "hg19_knownGene_sample.sqlite",
  package = "GenomicFeatures")
  txdb <- loadDb(txdbFile)

  # Extract sequences of fiveUTRs.
  fiveUTRs <- fiveUTRsByTranscript(txdb, use.names = TRUE)[1:10]
  faFile <- BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19::Hsapiens
  # need to suppress warning because of bug in GenomicFeatures, will
  # be fixed soon.
  tx_seqs <- suppressWarnings(extractTranscriptSeqs(faFile, fiveUTRs))

  # Find all ORFs on those transcripts and get their genomic coordinates
  fiveUTR_ORFs <- findMapORFs(fiveUTRs, tx_seqs)
  unlistedORFs <- unlist(fiveUTR_ORFs, use.names = TRUE)
  # group GRanges by ORFs instead of Transcripts
  fiveUTR_ORFs <- groupGRangesBy(unlistedORFs, unlistedORFs$names)

  # make some toy ribo seq and rna seq data
  starts <- unlist(ORFik:::firstExonPerGroup(fiveUTR_ORFs), use.names = FALSE)
  RFP <- promoters(starts, upstream = 0, downstream = 1)
  score(RFP) <- rep(29, length(RFP)) # the original read widths

  # set RNA seq to duplicate transcripts
  RNA <- unlist(exonsBy(txdb, by = "tx", use.names = TRUE), use.names = TRUE)

  computeFeatures(grl = fiveUTR_ORFs, orfFeatures =  TRUE, RFP = RFP, RNA = RNA,
                  Gtf = txdb, faFile = faFile)
}
```

You will now get a data.table with one column per score, the columns are named after
the different scores, you can now go further with prediction, or making plots.

# Grouping ORFs

Sometimes you want a GRangesList of orfs grouped by transcript, or you might want 
each orf as groups in the GRangesList. To do this more easily you can use the function
ORFik:::groupGRangesBy.

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
# fiveUTRs = fiveUTRsByTranscript(txdb, use.names = TRUE) # <- extract only 5' leaders
# 
# if (requireNamespace("BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19")) { 
# 
#   tx_seqs <- extractTranscriptSeqs(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19::Hsapiens, fiveUTRs) # <- Now get only fiveUTRs fastasequences
#   test_ranges <- findMapORFs(fiveUTRs,tx_seqs) # <- ORFs are now in test_ranges
#   
#   # test_ranges is now grouped by transcript, but we want them grouped by ORFs:
#   # we use the orfs exon column called ($names) to group, it is made by ORFik.
#   test_ranges <- unlist(test_ranges, use.names = FALSE)
#   test_ranges <- groupGRangesBy(test_ranges, test_ranges$names)
#   
#   # the orfs are now grouped by orfs. If we want to go back to transcripts we do:
#   
#   test_ranges <- groupGRangesBy(unlist(test_ranges, use.names = FALSE),
#     unique(names(unlist(test_ranges, use.names = FALSE))))
# }
```

# Aligning ribo-seq data centered on p-sites

Features like floss needs the ribo-seq data to be alligned for the p-site.
To do this, you can either do it manually by using plots from `ORFik`, to 
deduce the p-sites, or you can do it automaticly by using the package 
shoelaces(recomended). (automatic p-site finding is soon included with `ORFik` using shoelaces) 

Syntax of p-shifted bed files are:

column 1: Seqname (the chromosome)
column 2: start
column 3: end
column 4: width( all must be 1 width reads of the p-sites)
column 5: the original read lengths (i.g 26-34)
column 6: the strand ( + / - (* is not allowed))

The files can also be compressed by the following formats:
".gzip"
".gz"
".bgz"

# Predicting functional orfs

If you have found a set of orfs, and you have used the function ORFik:::computeFeatures
to find the features for those orfs, you can try to predict which orfs to might be coding.
To do this you can specify some cut-off for the features, so that most of the orfs get excluded.

An example could be:

For all orfs with ribo-seq fpkm < 1, filter out.
For all orfs with kozak score < 5, filter out.
For all orfs with ORFScore < 0.5, filter out.

The more strict you are, the less orfs you get. This smaller set can
be verified further with other ORF-tools, experiments or by proteomics.

Now an example on Upstream open reading frames(uorfs):

For all uorfs with ribo-seq fpkm bigger than coding sequences fpkm, keep them.

Even though the uorf is translated, it does not mean it regulates a gene-product.
Two ways to check this: 

One of the features is if the orf goes into the cds of its transcript, 
you can use it like this:
For all uorfs with distance between orf and cds > 0,
(which mean it does not goes into cds), filter out.
Now you will only have uorfs going into cds.

For all uorfs with distance to cds > 200, filter out.
Since the distance is so high, the ribosome most likely can 
reinitiate. But this also depends on the region between the uorf stop site, and
coding sequence start site.

Because of the small set of experimentally verified uorfs, it can be hard to know
what are good features for uorfs, ribo-seq features like the ones in this package, 
at least tries to predict what could be relevant.
